# Express Open Source Project

## Project Description
The "African Localities" open-source project is a platform designed to catalog and manage location names across Africa. It allows users to add, update, and retrieve location details based on a hierarchical structure of country, state, and city. This initiative aims to provide a comprehensive and accessible database of African localities for developers, researchers, and organizations.

### Key Objectives:
- Build a community-driven repository of African localities.
- Provide a RESTful API for developers to integrate African locality data into their applications.
- Foster collaboration by enabling users to contribute new locations or improve existing data.

### Use Cases:
1. Developers needing accurate location data for African regions.
2. Organizations working on logistics, e-commerce, or mapping applications in Africa.
3. Researchers requiring structured data on African localities.

## Overview
This project is an open-source application built using [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) and an in-memeroy data storage, a fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js. It serves as a foundation for creating scalable and robust web applications, providing a flexible structure and support for middleware.

## Features
- **RESTful API**: Fully-featured API for interacting with the application.
- **Modular Design**: Easy-to-maintain structure.
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling and customizable error responses.
- **Environment Configuration**: Configurable environment variables using `dotenv`.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jowc/africa-localities.git
   cd africa-localities
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add the following variables:
     ```env
     PORT=3000
     ```

## Usage

### Running the Server

Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Start the build compilation:
```bash
npm run build
```

Start the production server:
```bash
npm start
```

The application will run on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) by default.

### Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
